Some of the textures are compressed and more, also, PatnosD helped me.

If you are going to play, only play whit 6-7 AI Bots (Or it will works very laggy).

I recommend you play the game whit the vita overclocked (To have better performance).

The game have less music and textures due to crash errors. (You can put all in Unity using the original Source Code)

I deleted the speed line (to have better performance), so, if you want to add it, my source code have it.

Online Mode dosent works. (v4 can have it?...)

If you like PSVita and you know how to do ports, you can help me whit the code talking whit me in discord: Alfredo2000#6380

Original README:
Sanicball is discontinued and I will not be accepting any pull requests. However if you have trouble understanding parts the project structure or code you can message me directly (viciousbadger@protonmail.com), I'll try to help out.

The project is to be opened with Unity3D. It works best with version 5.3.5f1 of the editor (Available here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). If you use a newer version, Unity will attempt to upgrade the project, which will most likely leave a ton of bugs for you to fix first.

Also check out https://github.com/BK-TN/SanicballServerList, which lets you host a server list for the game.
